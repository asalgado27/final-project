COSC 112 Final Project

Developers: Adrian Salgado, Sophia Xu, Alicia Xin

7 billions years into the future, Earth is now dangerously close to the sun. The surface is uninhabitable for humans, but thankfully your ancestors from hundreds of generations ago built a bunker at the center of the earth. But now that the sun is too close and the bunker will not be safe for long. With the knowledge of the way out long lost, it is now up to you to find a way back through the Earth and into the cosmos.

Your Journey

You begin the game in your bunker at the center of the earth. In this frame, you can see your bunker and press keys to move around, explore, and pick up objects along the way. While your ancestors did not have much time to furnish the bunker before they had to leave the surface, you do see three mysterious doors in the bunker. Little did you know, these doors will be the key to escaping the center of the earth and that your bunker will somehow, magically, stay with you throughout your journey.

Your first task will be to find the key to the first door hidden somewhere within your bunker. While this will be a relatively simple quest as there are only so many places to hide a key on a bare bunker, the arduous challenge that you will face behind the first door will turn out to be much more difficult. For behind this door lies the Lava Biome. To make it to the surface, you must traverse these worlds while collecting objects and keys that will serve you well in the long journey ahead.

After making it to the surface of Earth, you then gain access to the next biome: the Tree Biome. Your goal is still the same: survive the biome and make it to the end. However, you may find that the route through the forest before you is not as straightforward as the Lava Biome. (Did that branch Platform just break when you jumped on it? Where are the keys? HINT: They are hidden behind thick foliage, but in the same positions as the ones in Lava Biome!) You will have to use your skills wisely to find the way through the surface and into the atmosphere.

Once you are in the atmosphere, the challenges you have faced thus far will seem childish. As now you encounter the true danger that started this all: the sun. All the skills you have gained and tools you have collected will be put to the test when you attempt to travel through the sky and into outer space. While we wish we could share more about the challenges you will encounter, no one from the bunker has ever traversed the Sky Biome and lived to tell the tale. (Did someone just fall through that cloud??)

So we wish you luck, young adventurer, as you begin this journey. It is our hope that you find a way to traverse the three biomes and make it to outer space where your ancestors’ ship awaits to take you to safety. Legend has it that the strange ancestral ship that lies beyond Earth’s atmosphere holds the answers to all the questions generations of bunker people have been asking. How was this bunker built? Why was an empty ship left just beyond the bounds of the atmosphere? Where did our ancestors go? And when did it all begin?

Go through the different doors and collect Keys that will help you leave. To move left, up, down, and right, use the keys A, W, S, and D respectively. To open a door, stand in front of it and press O. Doors will only open after collecting the three keys in each biome, as well as the three keys from each biome from before it. Note that you will not be able to jump higher once your feet leave the platform (that is, W will not allow you to float infinitely upward). 

The biomes include lava, forest, and sky. Each biome will contain three keys that will allow you to unlock the next one. Lastly, the end of each biome's obstacles will lead you to a door that opens back to the main base, except for Sky, which will lead you to the cosmos!
