COSC 112 Final Project

Developers: Adrian Salgado, Sophia Xu, Alicia Xin

Oh no! The world has advanced 7 billion years into the future. Earth is now dangerously close to the sun and you only have so much time to leave. Your ancestors built a bunker at the center of the earth long ago when the surface first became unlivable. But now that the sun is so close, the bunker will not be safe for long. It is up to you to find a way back through the Earth and to another planet to survive. Go through the different doors and collect Keys that will help you leave. To move left, up, down, and right, use the keys A, W, S, and D respectively. To open a door, stand in front of it and press O. Note that you will not be able to jump higher once your feet leave the platform (that is, W will not allow you to float infinitely upward). 

The biomes include lava, forest, and sky. Each biome will contain three keys that will allow you to unlock the next one. Lastly, the end of each biome's obstacles will lead you to a door that opens back to the main base, except for Sky, which will lead you to the rest of the cosmos!
